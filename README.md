# Design Patterns ‚Äî Java & Spring Boot + DDD + Hexagonal Architecture Examples

This repository contains practical, self-contained examples of common software design patterns implemented in **Java**, with some projects integrating **Spring Boot** to demonstrate real-world usage in enterprise-grade applications.

The goal is to show **clear, minimal, and idiomatic** implementations that follow clean architecture principles such as **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and **Hexagonal Architecture**, while also demonstrating how to integrate patterns into Spring Boot's dependency injection and configuration model.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository is organized by **design pattern**.  
Each folder contains one or more subprojects, ranging from pure Java ("vanilla") examples to fully wired Spring Boot applications.

| Pattern       | Project Name                                                                                                                                                                           | Technology Stack | Purpose |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|---------|
| **Command**   | [`reservation-usecase-invocation/vanilla`](https://github.com/gmartinez1985/design-patterns/tree/main/command/reservation-usecase-invocation-command/vanilla/)                         | Java (Vanilla) | Demonstrates the Command Pattern to decouple **use case execution** from invokers. Includes synchronous and asynchronous invokers, undo support, and logging via a command history. |
| **Mediator**  | [`reservation-usecase-invocation-mediator/vanilla`](https://github.com/gmartinez1985/design-patterns/tree/main/command/reservation-usecase-invocation-mediator/vanilla/)               | Java (Vanilla) | Demonstrates the Mediator Pattern to centralize use case orchestration. A mediator coordinates between a controller-like client and the use cases (create, cancel reservation), keeping them decoupled and routing requests through a single hub. |
| **Decorator** | [`reservation-domain-model-decoration/vanilla`](https://github.com/gmartinez1985/design-patterns/tree/main/decorator/reservation-domain-decorator/vanilla/src/com/example/reservation) | Java (Vanilla) | Demonstrates the Decorator Pattern applied to the **domain model**, composing a `Reservation` with add-ons (e.g., Breakfast, Airport Pickup) without changing core logic. |
|               | [`reservation-usecase-decoration/vanilla`](https://github.com/gmartinez1985/design-patterns/tree/main/decorator/reservation-usecase-decoration/vanilla)                                | Java (Vanilla) | Demonstrates the Decorator Pattern applied to a **use case** in a clean, framework-free style. |
|               | [`reservation-usecase-decoration/spring-hexagonal-ddd`](https://github.com/gmartinez1985/design-patterns/tree/main/decorator/reservation-usecase-decoration/spring-hexagonal-ddd)      | Java + Spring Boot | Same use case as above, implemented using **DDD + Hexagonal Architecture**, with decorators wired via Spring Boot configuration. |
|               | [`reservation-api-client-decorators`](https://github.com/gmartinez1985/design-patterns/tree/main/decorator/reservation-api-client-decorators/spring-hexagonal-ddd)                     | Java + Spring Boot | Applies the Decorator Pattern to a **REST client** (e.g., PaymentClient), adding cross-cutting concerns like caching, retries, and circuit breaking. |
|               | [`reservation-persistance-decoration`](https://github.com/gmartinez1985/design-patterns/tree/main/decorator/reservation-persistance-decoration/spring-hexagonal-ddd)                   | Java + Spring Boot | Uses the Decorator Pattern in the **persistence layer**, implementing behaviors such as caching and auditing without polluting core persistence logic. |
| **Observer**  | [`vanilla`](https://github.com/gmartinez1985/design-patterns/tree/main/observer/vanilla)                                                                                               | Java (Vanilla) | Pure Java implementation of the Observer Pattern, showing publisher‚Äìsubscriber mechanics without any frameworks. |
|               | [`spring-hexagonal-ddd`](https://github.com/gmartinez1985/design-patterns/tree/main/observer/spring-hexagonal-ddd)                                                                     | Java + Spring Boot | Observer Pattern applied in a Spring Boot REST client scenario, leveraging Spring‚Äôs event system. |
|               | [`observer-cqrs/spring-hexagonal-ddd`](https://github.com/gmartinez1985/design-patterns/tree/main/observer/observer-cqrs)                                                              | Java + Spring Boot | CQRS using Spring Events (Observer) to project from the write model (SQL) to the read model (MongoDB) with eventual consistency. |

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Java 17**
- **Spring Boot 3.5.3** (for Spring examples)
- **Maven 3.9.4** build system

## üìö How to Navigate

Each subproject is **self-contained**:
1. Navigate to the desired folder.
2. Read its `README.md` for pattern-specific details.
3. Run it independently (Spring Boot apps via `mvn spring-boot:run`, vanilla apps via `mvn exec:java` or an IDE).

---

## üîç Learning Approach

These examples aim to:
- **Show patterns in isolation** (vanilla examples).
- **Demonstrate patterns in realistic architectures** (Spring Boot + Hexagonal + DDD).
- Keep **business logic free from infrastructure concerns**.
- Use **configuration** for wiring behaviors instead of hardcoding.

## üïí Timeline of DDD + Hexagonal Projects

The **DDD + Hexagonal Architecture** projects in this repository were developed in the following order.  
They are **independent projects**, but as they were created one after another, each one reflects small improvements in **architecture, package organization, naming conventions, and testing practices**.

1. Observer ‚Äî spring-hexagonal-ddd
2. Decorator ‚Äî reservation-usecase-decoration 
3. Decorator ‚Äî reservation-api-client-decorators  
4. Decorator ‚Äî reservation-persistance-decoration  
5. Observer ‚Äî observer-cqrs/spring-hexagonal-ddd  
6. Command ‚Äî reservation-usecase-invocation-command
7. Mediator ‚Äî reservation-usecase-invocation
